# Flowmate

Flowmate is much like a [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), but without the time limit when working. It helps enters the state of [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) which in the pomodoro is interrupted by the time limit.

The name of the application comes from the [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) and the [mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(drink)) drink, wich is a traditional drink in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and southern Brazil, prepared by steeping dried leaves of yerba mate in hot water and is served with a metal straw from a shared hollow calabash gourd.
